I am an assistant professor of philosophy and CLAS-Honors preceptor of philosophy, jointly appointed by the philosophy department and the Honors college at the University of Maine. I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018. Before coming to UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.

I work in metaphysics, on topics of grounding, properties, modality, and those that lie at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy of language such as truthmaking, the nature of propositions, and ineffability. A significant part of my research tries to draw resources from both analytic philosophy and Chinese philosophy. I am hesitant to call what I am doing as "comparative philosophy," however, because I seldom compare views in different philosophical traditions. Rather, my approach is more comprehensive in the sense that I try to find ways to integrate theoretical resources in different philosophical traditions.
