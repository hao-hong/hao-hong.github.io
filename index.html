    <p>
      I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and the CLAS-Honors Preceptor of Philosophy at the University of Maine. I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018. Before coming to UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.

      My primary research interests are metaphysics and Chinese philosophy. I am especially interested in the nature of truth and metaphysical explanation in both Western (esp. analytic) and Eastern (esp. Chinese) philosophical traditions. I have broad teaching interests, including ethics, applied ethics, logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion. I also enjoy doing "experimental" philosophy, in the sense of "experimental" arts rather than "experimental" sciences.

      I have hobbies both inside and outside of philosophy. My most recent hobby inside of philosophy is reading Marxism and Deleuze. Outside of philosophy, I like avant-garde cinema, rock music (classic, punk, indie), college sports, and NFL (Go Colts!). And I love everything about trains.
