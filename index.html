    <p>
        I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and the CLAS-Honors Preceptor of Philosophy, jointed appointed by the Department of Philosophy and the Honors College at the University of Maine. I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018. Before coming to UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.

        My primary research area is metaphysics. My research draws resources from both analytic philosophy and Chinese philosophy. I am especially interested in the relation between the reality of the world and our representation of the reality of the world, which, to use Ted Sider's term, is the relation between the world and "the book of the world". Topics I am currently thinking about include truthmaking, nominalism vs. universalism (which covers the metaphysics of properties in analytic metaphysics, the relation between predicates and reality (Ming 名 and Shi 实) in ancient Chinese philosophy, and the correspondence between properties and predicates (Xing Ming Xiang Ou 形名相耦) in Daoist metaphysics), ineffability, and the Dao and/as the fundamental structure.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have broad teaching interests, including ethics, logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion. I am also interested in ways philosophy can be incorporated in the core curriculum in a liberal arts setting, such as first year seminars, "great books" sequences, tutorials, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have hobbies both inside and outside of philosophy. My most recent hobby inside of philosophy is reading Deleuze and psychoanalysis. Outside of philosophy, I like avant-garde cinema, rock music (classic, punk, indie), college sports, and professional football. I root for Indiana Hoosiers, Butler Bulldogs (when they are not playing the cross-road classics), and Indianapolis Colts. I am also a  railfan since I was a kid and a so-called "aviation enthusiast" since a year ago.
