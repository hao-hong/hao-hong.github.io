    <p>
      I am an assistant professor of philosophy and CLAS-Honors preceptor of philosophy, jointly appointed by the philosophy department and the Honors college at the University of Maine. I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018. Before coming to UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.

      <p>
	I work in metaphysics, on topics of grounding, properties, modality, and those that lie at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy of language such as truthmaking, the nature of propositions, and ineffability. A significant part of my research draws resources from both analytic philosophy and Chinese philosophy. I am hesitant to call what I am doing as “comparative philosophy,” however, because I seldom compare views in different philosophical traditions. Rather, my approach is more comprehensive in the sense that I try to find ways to integrate theoretical resources from different traditions into a unified famework. I am currently working on a couple of papers on Daoist metaphysics, exploring the ontological nature of the Dao, the ineffability of the Dao, and the relationship between them.
      </p>

      <p>
	I have broad teaching interests, including ethics, logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion. I am also interested in ways philosophy can be incorporated in the core curriculum in a liberal arts setting, such as first year seminars, “great books” programs, tutorials, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
	I have hobbies both inside and outside of philosophy. My most recent hobby inside of philosophy is reading Deleuze and psychoanalysis. Outside of philosophy, I like avant-garde cinema, rock music (classic, punk, indie), college sports, and professional football. I root for Indiana Hoosiers and Indianapolis Colts. I am also a railfan since I was a kid and a so-called “aviation enthusiast” since a year ago.
