      I am an assistant professor of philosophy and CLAS-Honors preceptor of philosophy, jointly appointed by the philosophy department and the Honors college at the University of Maine. I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018. Prior to UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.

	My primary research area is metaphysics. In my research, I try to ignore the boundaries between different philosophical traditions. Instead, I focus on philosophical questions and try to incorporate resources that are relevant to those questions, no matter which philosophical tradition and which historical period those resources are from. Nevertheless, I am more familiar with analytic philosophy and Chinese philosophy than other traditions. My works usually engage with resources in contemporary analytic metaphysics and metametaphysics, Aristotelian and Thomistic metaphysics, Neoplatonism, early modern rationalism, Daoism, Neo-daoism, and Buddhism.

	The two "big" questions that guide my research are: (1) How to develop an ontology that does not only include entities other than determinate physical objects, but also treats determinate physical objects as non-fundamental entities? (2) What is the relationship between a portion of reality and our accurate representation of it? Accordingly, I work on topics of grounding, metaphysical indeterminacy, the ontology of stuff, and those that lie at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy of language such as truthmaking, the nature of propositions, and ineffability.

	At UMaine, I regularly teach a wide range of philosophy courses, including Introduction to Philosophy, Classical Chinese Philsophy, Formal Logic, History of Modern Philosophy, and Metaphysics. I also regularly lead preceptorials and give guest lectures in the "Great Books" program in the Honors college.

Outside of philosophy, I like avant-garde cinema, rock music (classic, punk, indie), watching sports, and hiking with my family. I root for Indiana Hoosiers and Indianapolis Colts.
