    <p>
      I am an assistant professor of philosophy and CLAS-Honors preceptor of philosophy, jointly appointed by the philosophy department and the Honors college at the University of Maine. I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018. Before coming to UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.

      <p>
	I work in metaphysics, on topics of grounding, properties, modality, and those that lie at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy of language such as truthmaking, the nature of propositions, and ineffability. A significant part of my research draws resources from both analytic philosophy and Chinese philosophy. I am hesitant to call what I am doing as “comparative philosophy,” however, because I seldom compare views in different philosophical traditions. Rather, my approach is more comprehensive in the sense that I try to find ways to integrate theoretical resources from different traditions into a unified famework. I am currently working on a couple of papers on Daoist metaphysics, exploring the ontological nature of the Dao, the ineffability of the Dao, and the relationship between them.

      <p>
	I have broad teaching interests, including ethics, logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion. I am also interested in ways philosophy can be incorporated in the core curriculum in a liberal arts setting, such as first year seminars, “great books” programs, tutorials, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
	I have hobbies both inside and outside of philosophy. My most recent hobby inside of philosophy is reading Deleuze and psychoanalysis. Outside of philosophy, I like avant-garde cinema, rock music (classic, punk, indie), college sports, and professional football. I root for Indiana Hoosiers and Indianapolis Colts. I am also a railfan since I was a kid and a so-called “aviation enthusiast” since a year ago.

	    David Lewis offers two solutions to the problem of the many, one of which relies on supervaluationism and the other on the notion of “almost-identity” for the most part. In this paper, I argue that Lewis’ other metaphysical views constitute reasons to prefer his second solution to the first one. Specifically, Lewis’ theory of propositions and his counterpart theory give rise to two similar problems of the many, which I call “the problem of many propositions” and “the problem of many counterparts” respectively. While both Lewis’ solutions may solve the problem of the many with respect to objects in the actual world, I argue that only his second solution can solve the problem of many propositions and the problem of many counterparts. Therefore, for anyone who accepts Lewis’ metaphysical views on propositions and counterparts, they should embrace Lewis’ second solution to the problem of the many for the reason of unification.

        <li> "A Challenge to the New Metaphysics: deRosset, Priority, and Explanation," (with David Fisher and Timothy Perrine) <i>Synthese</i>. Forthcoming.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-019-02468-3">10.1007/s11229-019-02468-3</a>

	    Priority Theory is an increasingly popular view in metaphysics. By seeing metaphysical questions as primarily concerned with what explains what, instead of merely what exists, it promises not only an interesting approach to traditional metaphysical issues but also the resolution of some outstanding disputes. In a recent paper, Louis deRosset argues that Priority Theory isn’t up to the task: Priority Theory is committed to there being explanations that violate a formal constraint on any adequate explanation. This paper critically examines deRosset’s challenge to Priority Theory. We argue that deRosset’s challenge ultimately fails: his proposed constraint on explanation is neither well-motivated nor a general constraint. Nonetheless, lurking behind his criticism is a deep problem for prominent ways of developing Priority Theory, a problem which we develop.

	  "The Metaphysics of Dao in WANG Bi's Interpretation of <i>Laozi</i>," <i>Dao: A Journal of Comparative Philosophy</i>, Vol. 18, Issue 2, 2019.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11712-019-09657-4">10.1007/s11712-019-09657-4</a>

	  <ul>
	    WANG Bi 王弼 develops a metaphysic of Dao 道 in his Commentary on Laozi and “The Structure of Laozi’s Subtle Pointers.” I summarize this metaphysic as the following thesis: Dao is featureless and is the ultimate reason why the myriad things exist and are the ways they are. I develop a systematic account of this thesis: I provide an interpretation of the featurelessness of Dao and show how Dao’s featurelessness relates to its fundamental explanatory role as the ontological ground for the myriad things.
