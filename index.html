    <p>
      I am an assistant professor of philosophy and CLAS-Honors preceptor of philosophy, jointly appointed by the philosophy department and the Honors college at the University of Maine. 
    </p>
	  
	  <p> Before UMaine, I was a Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, Religion, and Classics at Butler University in 2017-2018.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p> I received my PhD in philosophy with a minor in the history and philosophy of science from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2018.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p> Before Indiana, I received my MA in philosophy (ethics concentration), BA in philosophy, and BA in economics (dual degree) from Peking University in Beijing, China.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p> Before PKU, I grew up in Weifang in Shandong Provice in China.</p>
	  
	  
    
      <p>
	My primary research area is metaphysics. I think and write on topics in metaphysics and in the overlap between metaphysics and philosophy of language, such as grounding, truthmaking, modality, properties, propositions, and ineffability in the analytic-philosophical style by engaging with theoretical resources in various philosophical traditions. 
      </p>
	  
	  
      <p>
	At UMaine, I regularly teach a wide range of philosophy courses, including Introduction to Philosophy, Classical Chinese Philsophy, Formal Logic, History of Modern Philosophy, and Metaphysics. I also regularly lead preceptorials and give guest lectures in the "Great Books" program in the Honors college.
      </p>

      <p>
Outside of philosophy, I like avant-garde art (film, music, etc.), watching sports, and cooking for and hiking with my family.
      </p>
