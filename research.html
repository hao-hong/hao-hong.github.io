<p> I think and write on topics in metaphysics and in the overlap between metaphysics and philosophy of language, such as grounding, truthmaking, modality, properties, propositions, and ineffability in the analytic-philosophical style by engaging with theoretical resources in various philosophical traditions. I am more familiar with contemporary analytic philosophy and Chinese philosophy than other traditions. 
</p>
	
<p> My research is topic or question based. I try to engage with ideas and theories as long as they are relevant to the topics I am interested in, no matter which philosophical traditions they are from. While I am reluctant to call myself an expert in any philosophical tradition, my works interact with resources in contemporary analytic metaphysics and metametaphysics, Aristotelian and Thomistic metaphysics, Neoplatonism, early modern rationalism, Daoism, Neo-daoism, and Buddhism. I also believe that it is impossible to exhaust theoretical resources on any topic in philosophy, and it is normal that we only focus on resources in a limited range of philosophical traditions. In this sense, I take "what you say has already been said by X in the tradition of Y" to be an appraise rather than a criticism.

	    David Lewis offers two solutions to the problem of the many, one of which relies on supervaluationism and the other on the notion of “almost-identity” for the most part. In this paper, I argue that Lewis’ other metaphysical views constitute reasons to prefer his second solution to the first one. Specifically, Lewis’ theory of propositions and his counterpart theory give rise to two similar problems of the many, which I call “the problem of many propositions” and “the problem of many counterparts” respectively. While both Lewis’ solutions may solve the problem of the many with respect to objects in the actual world, I argue that only his second solution can solve the problem of many propositions and the problem of many counterparts. Therefore, for anyone who accepts Lewis’ metaphysical views on propositions and counterparts, they should embrace Lewis’ second solution to the problem of the many for the reason of unification.

	    Priority Theory is an increasingly popular view in metaphysics. By seeing metaphysical questions as primarily concerned with what explains what, instead of merely what exists, it promises not only an interesting approach to traditional metaphysical issues but also the resolution of some outstanding disputes. In a recent paper, Louis deRosset argues that Priority Theory isn’t up to the task: Priority Theory is committed to there being explanations that violate a formal constraint on any adequate explanation. This paper critically examines deRosset’s challenge to Priority Theory. We argue that deRosset’s challenge ultimately fails: his proposed constraint on explanation is neither well-motivated nor a general constraint. Nonetheless, lurking behind his criticism is a deep problem for prominent ways of developing Priority Theory, a problem which we develop.

	    WANG Bi 王弼 develops a metaphysic of Dao 道 in his Commentary on Laozi and “The Structure of Laozi’s Subtle Pointers.” I summarize this metaphysic as the following thesis: Dao is featureless and is the ultimate reason why the myriad things exist and are the ways they are. I develop a systematic account of this thesis: I provide an interpretation of the featurelessness of Dao and show how Dao’s featurelessness relates to its fundamental explanatory role as the ontological ground for the myriad things.
